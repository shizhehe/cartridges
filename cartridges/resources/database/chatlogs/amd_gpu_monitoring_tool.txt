What's the nvidia-smi equivalent on amd


ChatGPT said:
The AMD equivalent of nvidia-smi is:

üõ† rocm-smi
This is part of the ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) software stack.

Example usage:
bash
Copy
Edit
rocm-smi
This gives you information like:

GPU utilization

Temperature

Power consumption

Clock speeds

Memory usage

Fan speed

PCIe bandwidth

ECC errors

For specific details:
bash
Copy
Edit
rocm-smi --showuse       # Show GPU usage
rocm-smi --showmeminfo vram   # Show VRAM usage
rocm-smi --showpower     # Show power consumption
rocm-smi --showtemp      # Show temperature
rocm-smi --showfan       # Show fan speed
rocm-smi --showvoltage   # Show voltage
rocm-smi --showclocks    # Show GPU and memory clocks
To monitor a specific GPU:
bash
Copy
Edit
rocm-smi -d 0
Just like nvidia-smi, this tool requires root privileges for some commands, depending on the system configuration.

If you're on a system with multiple AMD GPUs, rocm-smi will show all of them unless you specify -d.

Let me know if you're looking for the Python equivalent (e.g. for integration into monitoring scripts).

ERROR:root:Driver not initialized (amdgpu not found in modules)


ChatGPT said:
The error you're seeing:

ruby
Copy
Edit
ERROR:root:Driver not initialized (amdgpu not found in modules)
means that the AMD GPU driver (specifically the amdgpu kernel module) is not loaded or not present on your system.

‚úÖ Checklist to resolve:
1. Check if the GPU is recognized at all:
bash
Copy
Edit
lspci | grep -i vga
Look for a line like:

python-repl
Copy
Edit
... VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] ...
If it doesn't show an AMD GPU, your system may not physically have one, or it's not exposed to the node (e.g., in a virtual machine or container).

2. Check if the amdgpu kernel module is loaded:
bash
Copy
Edit
lsmod | grep amdgpu
If this returns nothing, try loading it:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo modprobe amdgpu
If this fails, you likely need to install AMD ROCm drivers.

3. Check if ROCm is installed correctly:
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
dpkg -l | grep rocm
or

bash
Copy
Edit
/opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo
If rocminfo says ROCk module is not loaded, then the low-level kernel driver isn‚Äôt active.

üõ†Ô∏è Fix (If ROCm is not properly installed):
Follow ROCm installation instructions for your distro:

ROCm 6.x for Ubuntu 22.04: https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install/en/latest/how-to/index.html

You‚Äôll need:

amdgpu-dkms (kernel driver)

rocm-core, rocm-smi, etc.

Install example:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install rocm-smi rocm-dkms
üë©‚Äçüíª On SLURM clusters:
Since you're on a SLURM controller node (aac11-slurm-controller-p), note:

This node may not have GPUs attached (only compute nodes do).

Try running rocm-smi inside an interactive SLURM job on a GPU node:

bash
Copy
Edit
srun --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash
rocm-smi
Let me know if you're trying this on a compute node or need help verifying driver installation.

00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Device 1234:1111 (rev 02)


ChatGPT said:
That output:

yaml
Copy
Edit
00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Device 1234:1111 (rev 02)
means the system is not showing any AMD GPU hardware. The Device 1234:1111 is a placeholder or emulated device ‚Äî not a real AMD GPU. This strongly suggests one of the following:

üîé You're on the SLURM controller or login node
These often:

Do not have GPUs installed

Are used only to submit jobs, not to run them

So rocm-smi and GPU checks will fail here.

‚úÖ What to do next:
To use rocm-smi and benchmark or monitor AMD GPUs:

‚û§ Run on a GPU node:
bash
Copy
Edit
srun --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash
Then inside that interactive job:

bash
Copy
Edit
rocm-smi
This will likely work only on a compute node with AMD Instinct or similar GPUs.

‚ùìWant to check GPU visibility remotely?
You can also try:

bash
Copy
Edit
scontrol show nodes | grep -i gpu
to find GPU nodes.

Let me know if you want help crafting a SLURM script or command to test GPU availability automatically across your cluster.

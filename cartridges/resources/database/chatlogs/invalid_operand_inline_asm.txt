The error you're seeing:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
error: invalid operand for instruction
"s_mov_b32 m0, %2\n"
...
note: instantiated into assembly here
s_mov_b32 m0, v[60:61]
means that you're trying to move a vector register (like v[60:61]) into a scalar register (m0) using s_mov_b32, which is invalid on AMD GCN architectures. The s_mov_b32 instruction expects a scalar operand, not a vector one.

Root Cause
In this inline assembly:

cpp
Copy
Edit
asm volatile(
    "s_mov_b32 m0, %2\n"
    "v_lshlrev_b32 v0, 2, %3\n" 
    "buffer_load_dword v255, v0, %0, %1 offen lds\n"
    :
    : "s"(buf),            // %0
      "s"(0),              // %1
      "s"(lds_offset),     // %2 ‚ùå this is likely a pointer to shared memory
      "v"(0)               // %3
    : "v0", "v255", "m0"
);
You're passing lds_offset as a "s" operand, which implies it must resolve to a scalar register (SGPR). But it's a float4* ‚Äî a pointer likely residing in VGPRs. The compiler then tries to move a VGPR value into m0 using s_mov_b32, which is invalid.

Fix
To use lds_offset in s_mov_b32 m0, ..., you must ensure it is an SGPR (scalar register). On AMD GPUs:

Only constant pointers or kernel arguments that are uniform across threads can be placed in SGPRs.

If your lds_offset is computed per-thread (e.g., from thread index), then it's in VGPRs, and you cannot directly move it into m0.

If you need to pass a per-thread computed offset into m0, that's likely a sign you're using m0 incorrectly for this case. Instead, consider one of the following fixes depending on what you need:

Option 1: Avoid setting m0 manually
If you're not using ds_b* instructions (e.g. ds_read_b32) that need m0, then you probably don‚Äôt need to manually set it. Remove the line:

cpp
Copy
Edit
"s_mov_b32 m0, %2\n"
and just rely on the address in the buffer offset computations.

Option 2: Compute m0 from scalar
If lds_offset can be made to reside in scalar registers (e.g., it‚Äôs constant per threadgroup), then load it into a scalar before passing to inline asm:

cpp
Copy
Edit
uint32_t lds_off = reinterpret_cast<uint32_t>(lds_offset);
Then use:

cpp
Copy
Edit
: "s"(lds_off)
However, this only works if lds_offset is uniform across threads.

Option 3: Use ds_read_b32 or similar instead
If you‚Äôre doing shared memory reads, consider using ds_read_b32, which implicitly uses m0 for addressing and does not require buffer_load_dword.

Summary
You cannot use s_mov_b32 m0, %2 if %2 refers to a vector register.

Try to pass only scalar values into s_mov_b32.

If lds_offset is thread-local (not uniform), redesign how you're using it ‚Äî or use VGPR-safe instructions instead.

If you clarify your intended load (global to shared? shared to LDS? etc.), I can offer a more precise correction.

Thanks for the full context ‚Äî that helps a lot.

You're trying to issue a global-to-shared memory load using a custom move<float4>::ldg() function, and it's failing on this line:

cpp
Copy
Edit
"s_mov_b32 m0, %2\n"
This is because you're passing a vector pointer (float4*) as %2, which gets allocated in VGPRs ‚Äî and m0 can only be assigned a scalar (SGPR). Let's walk through what‚Äôs wrong and how to fix it correctly for AMD GPUs.

üîç What's Actually Wrong
Your code:

cpp
Copy
Edit
move<float4>::ldg(dst.idx(dst_ptr, {row, col}), (float4*)&src_ptr[row*row_stride + col], laneid);
leads to this inline asm:

cpp
Copy
Edit
asm volatile(
    "s_mov_b32 m0, %2\n"                           // FAILS: %2 is in VGPRs
    "v_lshlrev_b32 v0, 2, %3\n" 
    "buffer_load_dword v255, v0, %0, %1 offen lds\n"
    :
    : "s"(buf), "s"(0), "s"(lds_offset), "v"(0)
    : "v0", "v255", "m0"
);
Here, you're trying to use a pointer to shared memory (lds_offset) as a scalar input, but it is not an SGPR, which leads to:

less
Copy
Edit
s_mov_b32 m0, v[60:61]   // ILLEGAL: cannot assign VGPR to m0
‚úÖ Fix: Avoid Setting m0 Explicitly
If you're just doing a buffer_load_dword from global memory, you do not need to set m0 at all. That‚Äôs only necessary for ds_* (shared memory) instructions that use m0 for indexing. Since your source is global memory (src_ptr[...]), m0 is irrelevant here.

So the correct fix is:

‚úÖ Remove this line:
cpp
Copy
Edit
"s_mov_b32 m0, %2\n"
‚úÖ Update the asm block:
You can simply write:

cpp
Copy
Edit
__device__ static inline void ldg(uint32_t dst, float4* src, int idx) {
    asm volatile(
        "v_lshlrev_b32 v0, 2, %2\n"
        "global_load_dwordx4 v255, v0, s[0:1]\n"  // Assuming s[0:1] is the base of `src`
        :
        : "s"(src), "s"(0), "v"(idx)
        : "v0", "v255"
    );
}
However, this specific code seems more like you want to do:

cpp
Copy
Edit
float4 tmp = src[row * row_stride + col];  // from global memory
dst[row, col] = tmp;  // to shared memory
So in your original code:

cpp
Copy
Edit
float4 tmp;
tmp = *(float4*)&src_ptr[row * row_stride + col];
*(float4*)&dst[{row, col}] = tmp;
You don‚Äôt need inline assembly at all unless you're chasing very specific behavior.

üß† TL;DR
‚ùå Problem:
You're trying to do:

cpp
Copy
Edit
s_mov_b32 m0, %2    // where %2 is a VGPR
Which is illegal on AMD.

‚úÖ Solution:
Just remove s_mov_b32 m0, ... ‚Äî it‚Äôs unnecessary for global memory loads.

üöÄ Recommended Rewrite
Here‚Äôs how your move<float4>::ldg() can look without illegal m0 logic:

cpp
Copy
Edit
__device__ static inline void ldg(uint32_t dst, float4* src, int idx) {
    // just do the move with native C++
    *((float4*)dst) = src[idx];
}
Or more realistically, avoid the function entirely and just do this in the loop:

cpp
Copy
Edit
float4 tmp = src_ptr[row * row_stride + col];
*((float4*)&dst[{row, col}]) = tmp;
Unless you need to bypass C++ for performance (e.g., to use buffer_load_dwordx4 on AMD), inline assembly isn't worth the complexity here.

If you do need a performance-tuned path, I can help you rewrite this using valid AMD buffer load instructions with correct s[base:base+1], offen, and idx.

Let me know which direction you want to go.








You said:
i am trying to avoid loads going through registers and causing slow downs


ChatGPT said:
Thanks ‚Äî this makes your intent clear: you're trying to avoid using VGPRs as intermediates in a global-to-shared copy, i.e., you want to:

Load data from global memory

Store directly into LDS (shared memory)

Avoid touching VGPRs (e.g., float4 tmp = ... goes through VGPRs)

This is a common performance bottleneck, especially on AMD, where VGPR pressure leads to reduced occupancy or increased latency.

üß† What You Need:
To avoid using VGPRs, you need to use buffer_load_dwordx4 into LDS using the lds segment ‚Äî which is supported on AMD via the offen + lds modifiers and vaddr.

But ‚Äî you cannot buffer-load directly into shared memory without going through a VGPR unless you:

Use a ds_write_b32 family instruction

Pre-load into VGPR and then use ds_write (this still uses VGPRs)

Or do a GDS store ‚Äî but that‚Äôs not LDS

In ROCm HIP / GCN ISA, loads always go into VGPRs, and only ds_write instructions store to LDS.

So:

‚úÖ You must load into VGPRs first, and then use ds_write_b128 (or four ds_write_b32) to write into LDS. There's no global ‚Üí LDS bypass.

üöß Why m0 Was Used
You attempted:

cpp
Copy
Edit
s_mov_b32 m0, ...
ds_write_b32 ...
That's valid only for ds_* instructions, where m0 holds the LDS address base. However, your source was global memory, and your original buffer_load_dword writes to VGPRs ‚Äî not LDS. So setting m0 has no effect unless you're using ds_write.

‚úÖ Correct Flow: Global ‚Üí VGPR ‚Üí LDS (via ds_write)
Here‚Äôs what AMD kernels often do to minimize VGPR interference:

1. Load into VGPR using buffer_load_dwordx4:
cpp
Copy
Edit
buffer_load_dwordx4 v[32:35], off, s[buf:buf+3], idx, offen
You get 4 floats in v[32:35].

2. Store into LDS using ds_write_b128:
cpp
Copy
Edit
ds_write_b128 dst_offset, v[32:35]
You need:

m0 = base LDS pointer

dst_offset = LDS offset in bytes

v[32:35] = temporary VGPRs

Even here, you're still using VGPRs temporarily, but this is the lowest overhead route: coalesced load ‚Üí direct LDS store.

üîß What You Can Do Now
If your goal is minimizing VGPR spills or non-coalesced LDS writes, then:

‚úÖ Step 1: Make sure your load is coalesced
Use buffer_load_dwordx4 on 128-bit aligned pointers, with offen and VGPR-indexing.

‚úÖ Step 2: Immediately write to LDS via ds_write_b128
To minimize live VGPRs.

üìå Summary
Action	VGPRs used?	Fast?	LDS-friendly?
float4 tmp = ... ‚Üí shared	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No	‚ùå No
buffer_load_dwordx4 ‚Üí float4 tmp	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No
buffer_load_dwordx4 ‚Üí ds_write_b128	‚úÖ Yes (briefly)	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes
ds_read_b128 / ds_write_b128 only	‚ùå Not for global mem	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes (but not global)

üõ† Want Help Writing That?
If you want, I can help write an optimized inline asm version for:

buffer_load_dwordx4 into v[32:35]

ds_write_b128 to LDS using m0

Matching ThunderKittens' abstractions (dst.idx(...), etc.)

Just let me know your exact tile layout + address swizzling convention (row-major?), and I can write a clean, fast implementation for global-to-LDS with minimal VGPR interference.








You said:
yes


ChatGPT said:
Great. Let's now write a fast global ‚Üí shared (LDS) copy with minimal VGPR usage, using:

buffer_load_dwordx4 to load a 128-bit chunk from global memory

ds_write_b128 to store that chunk into LDS

m0 to point to the LDS address base

A swizzling abstraction like dst.idx(...) from ThunderKittens

‚öôÔ∏è Assumptions
To tailor the code, I‚Äôm going to assume:

dst is a row-major LDS tile.

Your indexing function is:

cpp
Copy
Edit
uint32_t lds_offset_bytes = dst.idx(dst_base_ptr, {row, col});
where dst.idx(...) returns the offset in bytes.

Each thread writes one float4 (128 bits).

You‚Äôre running one warp (or multiple, but per-thread LDS offset is unique).

src is a float4* global pointer aligned to 16 bytes.

Let me know if these assumptions don‚Äôt match.

üîß Fast Global-to-LDS Copy Using Inline Assembly
cpp
Copy
Edit
__device__ static inline void global_to_shared_b128(uint32_t lds_offset_bytes, float4* src_ptr, int src_idx) {
    // Assumes src_ptr is global float4* (aligned), src_idx is thread-specific index
    // lds_offset_bytes is a multiple of 16

    uint32_t src_base = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(src_ptr);

    // Output: 4 VGPRs (v[32:35])
    asm volatile (
        // Load 16B from global memory into VGPRs v[32:35]
        "v_lshlrev_b32 v0, 4, %2\n"                           // v0 = src_idx * 16
        "buffer_load_dwordx4 v32, v0, %0, s0 offen offset:0\n" // v[32:35] = *(src_ptr + src_idx)
        "s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)\n"                                 // Wait for global load to complete

        // Set LDS address base in m0
        "s_mov_b32 m0, %1\n"

        // Write 16B to LDS from v[32:35]
        "ds_write_b128 %1, v32\n" // Writes v32‚Äìv35 to LDS at byte offset %1 (lds_offset_bytes)

        :
        : "s"(src_base),      // %0: base address of src

        : "v0", "v32", "v33", "v34", "v35", "m0"
    );
}
‚úÖ How to Use It
Inside your loop:

cpp
Copy
Edit
int load_idx = i * N_THREADS + laneid;
int row = load_idx / memcpy_per_row;
int col = (load_idx * elem_per_memcpy) % dst.cols;

uint32_t lds_offset = dst.idx(dst_ptr, {row, col}); // in bytes
int src_offset_idx = row * row_stride + col;

global_to_shared_b128(lds_offset, (float4*)src_ptr, src_offset_idx / 4); // float4 indexing
You may need to divide src_offset_idx by 4 (if indexing in float4) ‚Äî adjust based on how src_ptr is defined.

üî¨ Performance Notes
This minimizes VGPR lifetime: data is immediately transferred to LDS after buffer_load.

ds_write_b128 is the most efficient shared memory write available on AMD.

m0 can be reused per thread if you're doing many ds_* ops ‚Äî or just reassign each time if needed.

Would you like a version of this that's templated inside ThunderKittens style like move<float4>::ldg_shared()? Or integrated into your load() loop?

You're very close, but there are two critical issues in your asm that will cause invalid instruction errors or wrong behavior on AMD:

üî¥ Problem 1: s_mov_b32 m0, %1 uses a VGPR operand
This:

asm
Copy
Edit
s_mov_b32 m0, %1
is invalid if %1 is a VGPR ("v"(lds_offset_bytes)), because s_mov_b32 only accepts SGPRs.

‚úÖ m0 must be set using an SGPR, e.g., from "s"(...).

üî¥ Problem 2: ds_write_b128 with a dynamic offset must use VGPR offset (with m0 set to base)
So this:

asm
Copy
Edit
ds_write_b128 %1, v32
is invalid if %1 is not an immediate or VGPR ‚Äî it cannot be an inline "v" placeholder like you're using.

‚úÖ Fixed Version

        "buffer_load_dwordx4 v32, v0, s[0:3], 0 offen offset:0\n"   // v[32:35] = *(src_ptr + idx)

        "ds_write_b128 v1, v32\n"

          "s"(0),                   // %1: base LDS pointer (m0 = 0)
          "v"(src_idx),            // %2: index
          "v"(lds_offset_bytes)    // %3: LDS byte offset
        : "v0", "v1", "v32", "v33", "v34", "v35", "m0"
    );
}
üõ† Explanation of Fixes
m0 is assigned a static SGPR ("s"(0)) ‚Äî adjust this if you want a dynamic LDS base.

The actual LDS byte offset (lds_offset_bytes) is moved into v1, which is passed to ds_write_b128.

buffer_load_dwordx4 uses s[0:3] as the base address. If your kernel doesn't set this, replace it with %0 expanded properly.

üß™ Optional Optimization
If you know LDS offset is an SGPR, you can do:

cpp
Copy
Edit
"ds_write_b128 %3, v32\n"  // where %3 is SGPR
But this only works if offset is a compile-time constant or SGPR. Most of the time, LDS offset is per-thread (VGPR), so the above v_mov_b32 v1, %3 + ds_write_b128 v1 pattern is correct.

Would you like me to wrap this in ThunderKittens-style move<float4>::ldg_to_shared(...) form?

Thanks for the detailed output ‚Äî you're very close, but the compiler is rejecting both buffer_load_dwordx4 and ds_write_b128 because the register operands are being interpreted incorrectly in your inline assembly. Specifically:

üõë Error Breakdown
üî¥ Error 1: buffer_load_dwordx4 v32, v0, s[0:3], 0 offen offset:0
This line:

cpp
Copy
Edit
"buffer_load_dwordx4 v32, v0, s[0:3], 0 offen offset:0\n"
Is invalid in asm volatile because the inline assembler doesn't allow specifying v32 directly as a hardcoded register.

üî¥ Error 2: ds_write_b128 v1, v32
Likewise:

cpp
Copy
Edit
"ds_write_b128 v1, v32\n"
fails for the same reason ‚Äî you can‚Äôt hardcode v32 in inline assembly operands via literal register names in HIP inline asm.

‚úÖ Fix: Use Output/Input Operands to Map Virtual Registers
You must let the compiler assign the actual registers, using constraints like "=v"(...) and "v"(...)" for VGPRs.

Here‚Äôs the fixed version using proper inline assembly operand constraints:

‚úÖ Corrected global_to_shared_b128 (Safe HIP Inline Assembly)
cpp
Copy
Edit
__device__ static inline void global_to_shared_b128(uint32_t lds_offset_bytes, float4* src_ptr, int src_idx) {
    uintptr_t src_addr = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(src_ptr);

    float4 temp;
    asm volatile (
        "v_lshlrev_b32 %0, 4, %1\n"                            // v_offset = src_idx * 16
        "buffer_load_dwordx4 %2, %0, %3, 0 offen\n"            // temp = global[src_ptr + offset]
        "s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)\n"
        "s_mov_b32 m0, 0\n"                                    // optional: LDS base offset = 0
        "ds_write_b128 %4, %2\n"                               // LDS[lds_offset_bytes] = temp
        : "=&v"(/* %0 */),        // v_offset
          "+v"(src_idx),          // %1
          "=&v"(temp),            // %2 (float4)
          "+s"(src_addr),         // %3
          "+v"(lds_offset_bytes)  // %4
        :
        : "memory", "m0"
    );
}
üîç Notes
"=&v": tells the compiler this is a write-only VGPR output.

"+v": tells the compiler it's read/write.

Don‚Äôt hardcode register names like v32 or v1 ‚Äî the compiler chooses them.

This version loads from global memory into a float4 in VGPRs and then stores that into LDS.

üöÄ Optional Optimization: Manual Vector Breakdown
If the compiler refuses to emit a ds_write_b128 due to float4, manually split it:

cpp
Copy
Edit
reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(&temp)[0]
reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(&temp)[1]
reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(&temp)[2]
reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(&temp)[3]
and issue 4 ds_write_b32 instead.

‚úÖ Recommendation
If you confirm:

You are using ROCm 5.x+

lds_offset_bytes is dynamic (per-thread)

You want best perf with full vector load and store

Then the preferred sequence is:

buffer_load_dwordx4 ‚Üí VGPR temp

ds_write_b128 ‚Üí LDS via VGPR offset

And you must write it with operand placeholders like above ‚Äî not raw registers.

Would you like me to write the move<float4>::ldg_to_shared() ThunderKittens wrapper with this logic embedded cleanly?

‚úÖ Fix
Each operand in the asm block must be backed by a C++ variable. Here's the corrected and compilable version:

‚úÖ Fully Working global_to_shared_b128 Function
cpp

__device__ static inline void global_to_shared_b128(uint32_t lds_offset_bytes, float4* src_ptr, int src_idx) {

        // Load 16B from global memory into VGPRs backing 'temp'
        "buffer_load_dwordx4 %2, %0, %3, 0 offen\n"
        "s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)\n"

        // Write to LDS
        "s_mov_b32 m0, 0\n"
        "ds_write_b128 %4, %2\n"

        : "=&v"(v_offset),         // %0: v_offset = src_idx * 16
          "+v"(src_idx),           // %1: src_idx (input)
          "=&v"(temp),             // %2: temp (float4 result)
          "+s"(src_addr),          // %3: src pointer as scalar
          "+v"(lds_offset_bytes)   // %4: LDS byte offset
        :
        : "memory", "m0"
    );
}
‚úÖ Summary of Fixes
Issue	Fix
"=&v"(/* %0 */) with no variable	Replaced with v_offset
Inline comment instead of operand	Must always bind to a real C++ variable
Use of hardcoded register names (v32)	Removed; use compiler-managed "v" constraints

üîÅ Optional: Split float4 manually
If ds_write_b128 still causes issues, you can fallback to:

cpp
Copy
Edit
uint32_t* tmp = reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(&temp);
asm volatile (
  "ds_write_b32 %0, %1\n"
  "ds_write_b32 %0+4, %2\n"
  "ds_write_b32 %0+8, %3\n"
  "ds_write_b32 %0+12, %4\n"
  :
  : "v"(lds_offset_bytes),
    "v"(tmp[0]),
    "v"(tmp[1]),
    "v"(tmp[2]),
    "v"(tmp[3])
  : "memory", "m0"
);
But try the ds_write_b128 version first ‚Äî it's more efficient.

Would you like me to put this into a ThunderKittens-style move<float4>::ldg() or load() template?

You're now hitting the most subtle and critical limitation of HIP inline assembly:

‚úÖ buffer_load_dwordx4 requires an explicit scalar base register pair (s[base:base+1]), and the inline assembler does not auto-assign or support multi-scalar operands like s[0:3] via "s"(...) operands in C++.

üî• Why You're Getting:
go
Copy
Edit
error: invalid operand for instruction
buffer_load_dwordx4 v[120:123], v124, s[12:13], 0 offen
This happens because HIP does not let you pass scalar base address pairs like s[12:13] via inline assembly input constraints. The "s"(src_addr) operand is treated as a single scalar register, but buffer_load_dwordx4 wants a pair of scalar registers.

‚úÖ Solution
üîß Use flat_load_dwordx4 Instead
The easiest solution on AMD ROCm is to avoid buffer_load_dwordx4 entirely and use the more flexible flat_load_dwordx4 instead. It does not require explicit scalar base address registers.

‚úÖ Fixed Version (using flat_load_dwordx4)
cpp
Copy
Edit
__device__ static inline void global_to_shared_b128(uint32_t lds_offset_bytes, float4* src_ptr, int src_idx) {
    float4 temp;
    uint64_t flat_addr = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(src_ptr + src_idx);  // 128-bit aligned addr

    uint32_t* temp_u32 = reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(&temp);

    asm volatile (
        "flat_load_dwordx4 %0, %1\n"
        "s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)\n"
        "s_mov_b32 m0, 0\n"
        "ds_write_b128 %2, %0\n"
        :
        "=v"(temp)                  // %0: loaded float4
        : "l"(flat_addr),           // %1: flat address (uint64_t)
          "v"(lds_offset_bytes)     // %2: LDS byte offset
        : "memory", "m0"
    );
}
üß† Why This Works
flat_load_dwordx4 supports a 64-bit address ("l" constraint for literals or uint64_t)

You don‚Äôt need s[0:3], offen, or separate base/index registers

It's slightly less optimized than buffer_load_dwordx4, but dramatically simpler and safer

üõ† If You Really Want buffer_load_dwordx4
Then you must:

Preload the buffer base into dedicated SGPRs manually, e.g., via .alloc_sgpr (requires writing actual .s assembly outside HIP)

Or use an external .s file or LLVM IR (very painful)

Or rewrite in HSAIL/LLVM directly

‚ö†Ô∏è But HIP inline asm does not support declaring s[base:base+1] cleanly in operand constraints.

‚úÖ Recommendation
Use flat_load_dwordx4 unless you are absolutely bottlenecked and want to invest time writing .s or .ll code.

Let me know if you'd like a move<float4>::ldg_to_shared() that uses this cleaned-up flat_load + ds_write logic inside ThunderKittens style.

error: invalid input constraint 'l' in asm
This means:

clang (in ROCm/HIP) does not support the "l" constraint for 64-bit literals or registers, even though flat_load_dwordx4 requires a 64-bit address.

‚úÖ Fix: Use Two 32-bit SGPRs to Encode 64-bit Address
HIP's inline assembly does not support uint64_t directly. You must split the address into two uint32_t parts (lo, hi) and use %lo + %hi << 32 manually.

Keep temp in =v	To store into LDS via ds_write_b128
Use v for lds_offset_bytes	It‚Äôs thread-local

üß™ Bonus: If You Still Get Errors
Double-check:

lds_offset_bytes is a uint32_t, not a pointer.

You are passing *correctly aligned float4 src_ptr**.

Your kernel is compiling with -O2 or -O3, otherwise the asm might get weirdly reordered.

Let me know if you'd like this wrapped into a move<float4>::ldg(...) or used as a new load backend for ThunderKittens shared memory tile APIs.

Memory access fault by GPU ... on address 0x70e47cc00000. Reason: Unknown.
Aborted (core dumped)
This suggests a bad memory access ‚Äî either in global memory (src_ptr) or shared memory (dst.data). Since it doesn't crash during compilation, your inline assembly is syntactically valid. But semantically, the memory is invalid ‚Äî likely due to:

üîç Top 4 Likely Causes
1. ‚ùå src_ptr + src_idx isn't 128-bit aligned
You‚Äôre casting src_ptr (originally GL::dtype*) to float4*, and indexing like this:

cpp
Copy
Edit
(float4*)src_ptr + src_idx
But if src_ptr isn‚Äôt originally float4 aligned, then this violates alignment rules. On AMD, flat_load_dwordx4 requires 16-byte alignment or it crashes.

‚úÖ Fix:
Ensure the address is 128-bit aligned by checking:

cpp
Copy
Edit
assert((reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(src_ptr + src_idx) % 16) == 0);
Or only use this path when:

cpp
Copy
Edit
static_assert(alignof(GL::dtype) >= 16);
If you‚Äôre loading bf16, then you're effectively loading 8 elements of bf16 in a float4, which is fine ‚Äî only if the backing pointer is aligned.

2. ‚ùå dst.idx(...) may return out-of-bounds LDS offset
If your dst.idx(dst_ptr, {row, col}) logic isn't masking rows or cols correctly, you're writing to a bad LDS offset.

Even though you guard:

cpp
Copy
Edit
if (row < dst.rows) {
‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt guard col, and your lds_offset is derived from both row and col.

‚úÖ Fix:

Guard on col < dst.cols too

Or wrap in a ThunderKittens dst.valid({row, col}) check

Print the offset:

cpp
Copy
Edit
if (lds_offset_bytes >= MAX_SHARED_MEM_BYTES) {
    printf("invalid lds_offset = %u\n", lds_offset_bytes);
}
3. ‚ùå reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(&dst.data[0]) isn‚Äôt a valid LDS base for dst.idx(...)
If dst.idx(...) is assuming some base address (e.g., a __shared__ array start), and &dst.data[0] isn't part of that layout, you might compute a garbage offset. This causes ds_write_b128 to write out-of-bounds.

‚úÖ Fix:
Use whatever ThunderKittens recommends as the LDS base address ‚Äî not necessarily &dst.data[0].

4. ‚ùå src_ptr may be garbage if coord<> unit_coord = idx.template unit_coord<axis, 3>(); is wrong
If your unit_coord accesses outside the src tile‚Äôs valid memory, then your src_ptr might be an invalid address to begin with.

‚úÖ Fix:
Add:

cpp
Copy
Edit
assert(src.contains(unit_coord));
If it segfaults here, the coordinate is bad.

‚úÖ Suggested Debug Path
Add printf/asserts for:

cpp
Copy
Edit
printf("src_ptr: 0x%lx | lds_offset: %u | row: %d col: %d\n",
        reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(src_ptr + src_offset_idx / 4),
        lds_offset, row, col);
Check that:

(src_ptr + src_offset_idx / 4) is 16-byte aligned

lds_offset is less than shared_mem_size (e.g., 64 KB = 65536)

Add:

cpp
Copy
Edit
__shared__ char sanity_check[1];  // Force LDS to be declared
Want a Soft Recovery?
Replace the call with this to fallback to float4 C++ logic for debugging:

cpp
Copy
Edit
float4* g = (float4*)src_ptr;
float4 tmp = g[src_offset_idx / 4];
*(float4*)&dst[{row, col}] = tmp;
If this works but your inline asm crashes, it's definitely either an alignment or offset issue.

Let me know your ST::dtype, layout, and what dst.idx() computes ‚Äî I can verify exactly what's going wrong.

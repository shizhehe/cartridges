Jerry Liu initially thought the cone-width discussion should be in the results section because it needs setup. Sabri Eyuboglu suggested cone-width as the challenge and RMS-norm as the solution. Jerry then thought it could be a solution in the intro. Roberto Garcia was concerned about the informal definition and wanted to make it clear that narrow cone-width is the challenge, solved by widening through techniques.\\n\\nSo the main points are the debate on placement, the shift from challenge to solution, and the agreement to clarify the narrative.

Also, mention that the informal definition was clarified as a challenge addressed by specific techniques.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe email conversation revolves around the placement of the **cone-width** concept in the MLP introduction document and its narrative structure.

requiring context.  \\n   - **Sabri Eyuboglu** proposed framing cone-width as the **challenge** and RMS-norm as the **solution**, aligning with a problem-solution narrative.  \\n   - **Jerry Liu** later considered it a potential **solution** in the introduction but acknowledged the need for setup.  \\n\\n2. **Narrative Agreement**:  \\n   - **Roberto Garcia** emphasized the importance of clarifying cone-width as a **challenge** (narrow cone-width being problematic) and resolving it by **widening the cone through techniques** (e.g., architectural or training methods).  \\n   - The group agreed that the narrative should follow a **challenge-solution structure**: narrow cone-width as the issue, with the proposed methods (e.g., RMS-norm, wider architectures) as the resolution.  \\n\\n3. **Clarification of Definition**:  \\n   - Roberto Garcia noted the informal definition of cone-width (\"output sensitivity to input\") and confirmed that framing it as a **challenge** (narrow cone-width) and addressing it through widening techniques would make the narrative clearer and more natural.  \\n\\n**Resolution**: The discussion resolved that cone-width should be positioned as a **challenge** in the introduction, with the solution (widening the cone via specific techniques) presented as the approach to address it, ensuring a coherent and structured narrative.',

The informal definition of cone-width (\"output sensitivity to input\") was confirmed, and the narrative was clarified to ensure a coherent **problem-solution pair** in the document’s structure.  \\n\\nIn summary, the group agreed that cone-width should be framed as a challenge in the introduction, with the solution (widening the cone) presented as the method to address it, ensuring a natural and structured narrative.', role='assistant', token_ids=[151667, 198, 32313, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 264, 12126, 315, 279, 2551, 4516, 911, 279, 330, 58082, 9347, 1, 7286, 304, 279, 94891, 16800, 2197, 13, 6771, 752, 1191, 553, 88646, 279, 1376, 3501, 504, 279, 3681, 10435, 382, 5338, 11, 279, 1887, 11004, 572, 3425, 22161, 9347, 1265, 387, 304, 279, 16800, 476, 279, 3059, 3772, 13, 28708, 37705, 3381, 432, 4362, 803, 6505, 11, 773, 7196, 279, 3059, 13, 20603, 461, 11827, 432, 438, 264, 8645, 11, 448, 77178, 5279, 493, 438, 279, 6291, 13, 5005, 28708, 6509, 432, 264, 6291, 304, 279, 19706, 714, 3381, 432, 4362, 2266, 13, 54083, 37710, 3381, 807, 1033, 3730, 1632, 26312, 22161, 9347, 6051, 745, 714, 4829, 311, 4034, 432, 438, 264, 8645, 11, 27956, 553, 84400, 279, 22161, 1526, 12538, 382, 785, 10935, 572, 429, 22161, 9347, 1265, 387, 264, 8645, 304, 279, 19706, 11, 20068, 553, 3259, 432, 21864, 448, 3151, 5413, 13, 576, 1196, 1083, 6801, 279, 12126, 311, 11167, 279, 11004, 11, 9128, 389, 8645, 1331, 3214, 11, 323, 279, 10935, 311, 37163, 279, 3491, 1331, 3214, 6716, 382, 40, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 279, 12126, 374, 63594, 11, 14521, 678, 1493, 3501, 11, 323, 5711, 2797, 4128, 13, 7281, 11, 1779, 421, 1052, 594, 894, 1008, 10908, 681, 358, 2578, 614, 13628, 13, 6771, 752, 5944, 432, 3019, 553, 3019, 25, 1191, 448, 279, 11004, 389, 21448, 11, 1221, 279, 9128, 389, 8645, 1331, 3214, 11, 323, 279, 10935, 13, 7405, 2704, 311, 6286, 279, 1376, 13026, 323, 862, 19026, 13, 34006, 502, 70821, 714, 2506, 432, 13382, 13, 97593, 11, 429, 1265, 3421, 432, 624, 151668, 271, 785, 2551, 4516, 34334, 279, 21448, 323, 19221, 315, 279, 3070, 1, 58082, 9347, 1, 334, 7286, 304, 279, 94891, 16800, 2197, 11, 448, 279, 2701, 1376, 3501, 25, 18611, 16, 13, 3070, 1912, 70529, 389, 77416, 95518, 2303, 256, 481, 3070, 89657, 37705, 334, 11827, 7218, 279, 10219, 315, 22161, 9347, 311, 279, 3070, 8074, 3772, 334, 4152, 311, 279, 1184, 369, 65151, 6505, 11, 438, 432, 374, 264, 10916, 7716, 22703, 16148, 13, 2303, 256, 481, 3070, 76378, 461, 43411, 392, 538, 9835, 334, 10981, 57949, 22161, 9347, 438, 279, 3070, 57365, 334, 323, 77178, 5279, 493, 438, 279, 3070, 49460, 97219, 5285, 287, 448, 264, 3491, 1331, 3214, 19221, 13, 2303, 256, 481, 3070, 89657, 37705, 334, 2937, 6509, 432, 264, 4650, 3070, 49460, 334, 304, 279, 16800, 714, 25498, 279, 1184, 369, 6505, 311, 37163, 1181, 3476, 13, 18611, 17, 13, 3070, 9042, 17150, 389, 95721, 95518, 2303, 256, 481, 3070, 14465, 13878, 37710, 334, 45628, 279, 12650, 315, 19497, 7766, 22161, 9347, 438, 264, 3070, 57365, 334, 320, 77, 6044, 22161, 9347, 1660, 34933, 8, 323, 52483, 432, 553, 3070, 43615, 6019, 279, 22161, 1526, 3151, 12538, 334, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 42463, 476, 4862, 5413, 568, 2303, 256, 481, 576, 1874, 7230, 429, 279, 19221, 1265, 1795, 264, 3070, 57365, 1331, 3214, 5944, 95518, 15026, 22161, 9347, 438, 279, 4265, 11, 448, 279, 10981, 5413, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 77178, 5279, 493, 11, 21864, 77235, 8, 438, 279, 10935, 13, 18611, 18, 13, 3070, 38106, 95518, 2303, 256, 481, 576, 10219, 19673, 429, 22161, 9347, 1265, 387, 34228, 438, 264, 3070, 57365, 334, 304, 279, 16800, 11, 448, 279, 6291, 320, 43615, 6019, 279, 22161, 4566, 3151, 12538, 8, 10449, 438, 279, 5486, 311, 2621, 432, 13, 2303, 256, 481, 576, 41787, 7271, 315, 22161, 9347, 3489, 3006, 26443, 311, 1946, 899, 572, 10774, 11, 323, 279, 19221, 572, 64776, 311, 5978, 264, 55787, 3070, 34586, 1331, 3214, 6716, 334, 304, 279, 2197, 748, 5944, 13, 18611, 641, 12126, 11, 279, 1874, 7230, 429, 22161, 9347, 1265, 387, 45993, 438, 264, 8645, 304, 279, 16800, 11, 448, 279, 6291, 320, 43615, 6019, 279, 22161, 8, 10449, 438, 279, 1714, 311, 2621, 432, 11, 22573, 264, 5810, 323, 32930, 19221, 13, 151645], top_logprobs=None, mask=None)], system_prompt='\\nYou are in a conversation about the following user information.\\n\\n<info>\\nFrom: \"Roberto Garcia (Google Docs)\" <comments-noreply@docs.google.com>\\nSubject: MLP Intros -

They want me to generate a single instruction for an LLM to summarize the most important part of the email conversation. \\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the email content provided. The conversation starts with a brief issue brief about adverse event reporting for AI, mentioning Stanford RegLab and HAI. It talks about the challenges in AI deployment, like unexpected behaviors by systems like GPT-4. Then there's a mention of a Washington Post article discussing child safety tech and a European Commission event. The user also provided some links and contact info.\\n\\nThe main points here are the issue brief's focus on adverse event reporting as a solution to AI risks, the importance of real-world testing, and the collaboration between policymakers, industry, and stakeholders. The key elements are the problem (underappreciated risks of AI post-deployment), the solution (adverse event reporting systems), and the implications for policy and industry.\\n\\nI need to make sure the instruction is concise and captures the essence. The user wants the LLM to summarize the most important part, so I should combine all these elements into a single, clear summary. Avoid any extra details and focus on the key elements: the problem, the solution, and the collaboration aspects. Let me check if I missed any critical points. The issue brief's recommendations for tailoring systems without requiring massive spending seem important too. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the instruction should highlight the problem of underappreciated AI risks post-deployment, the need for adverse event reporting systems to address these, and the collaborative approach between policymakers and stakeholders. That should cover the main points without being too verbose.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Instruction for LLM:** Summarize the key points of the email conversation by focusing on the issue brief about adverse event reporting for AI, the challenges in addressing AI risks post-deployment, and the recommendations for policymakers, industry, and stakeholders to enhance AI safety through real-world data-driven insights.<|im_end|>\""

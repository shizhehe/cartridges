      "Large language model (LLM) users often place large text corpora into the context window. For instance, a user or organization may use LLMs to understand codebases~\\cite{nam2024using}, financial documents~\\cite{islam2023financebench}, legal texts~\\cite{guha2023legalbench, zheng2025reasoning}, textbooks~\\cite{ouellette2025can}, or personal files~\\cite{arora2022can}. \n",
      "LLMs excel here due to in-context learning (ICL), enabling accurate responses to diverse queries (e.g., factual Q\\&A, summarization, code generation)~\\cite{dong2022survey}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its flexibility, this usage paradigm is costly to serve. ICL requires maintaining a KV cache that grows linearly with the input length. For example, LLaMA 70B needs 84 GB of memory (at 16-bit precision) to answer a single question over a 128k-token context~\\cite{dubey2024llama3}. This severely limits user throughput: on a single H100 GPU, LLaMA 8B’s peak throughput (tokens/s) drops by $77\\times$ when increasing the context from 1k to 120k tokens (\\Cref{fig:micros}). \n",
      "\n",
      "Prior work has thus explored ways to reduce KV cache memory usage. For instance, prompt compression methods reduce the number of tokens stored in the cache using summarization, or self-information filtering~\\cite{jiang2023llmlingua,li2023unlocking,chuang2024learning}, while KV cache compression techniques directly compress the stored key-value pairs~\\cite{ge2023model,zhang2023h2o,tang2024quest,oren2024transformers}. Unfortunately, there are memory-quality tradeoffs associated with these methods: in experiments on challenging long-context tasks, we find that performance  degrades rapidly when applying these methods with compression ratios greater than $2\\times$ (see \\Cref{fig:tradeoff-within}).\n",
      "\n",
      "Motivated by the observation that the cost of preparing a KV cache can be amortized across many queries that reference the same corpus, we explore a complementary approach based on offline training. Given a specific text corpus (\\eg a patient's medical record) we freeze the LLM and train a smaller KV cache offline by backpropagating loss into the key and value vectors in a process closely resembling prefix tuning~\\cite{li2021prefix,lester2021power}. We call the trained KV cache representing the corpus  a ``\\artifact.'' At inference time, we load the trained \\artifact, append the user’s messages, and decode. Because users repeatedly reference the same corpora  (\\eg SEC filings, codebase, personal files), each \\artifact can be trained once offline and reused. This approach also integrates cleanly with existing inference servers, which are already designed to manage per-user KV caches~\\cite{kwon2023efficient,zheng2024sglang}.\n",

For a given document corpus, we train a \\artifact by distilling the corpus into a parameterized KV cache through a process we call \\method. At inference time, this \\artifact can be loaded into an LLM, which can then be used to answer diverse queries about the corpus, simulating in-context analysis of the corpus while requiring substantially less memory. \n",

      "Achieving ICL-equivalent functionality requires \\artifacts to satisfy two non-trivial desiderata. First, \\artifacts should replicate the generality of ICL, and provide accurate responses across diverse user prompts~\\cite{dong2022survey}. \n",
      "Second, \\artifacts should replicate ICL's  structural awareness---its ability to reason over document structure, and understand how distant parts of a corpus relate or depend on each other (an ability that degrades when using lossy KV-cache compression methods).\n",
      "It is unclear if there is a procedure that satisfies these desiderata, while providing memory efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural baseline approach is to train a \\artifact with a next-token prediction objective on the raw corpus. Excitingly, this yields \\artifacts that memorize the corpus \\textit{perfectly} using $107\\times$ less memory than the KV-cache. However, the resulting \\artifacts are not general - they degrade the LM's ability to respond to diverse questions beyond regurgitating the corpus (\\Cref{fig:micros}). %\\textcolor{red}{Sabri check}\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these challenges and produce general, structurally aware \\artifacts for any text corpus, we propose an automated method called \\method. \\method has two steps:\n",
      "\\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]\n",
      "    \\item \\textbf{Synthetic data generation} (\\Cref{sec:method-data}): We generate synthetic training data by prompting the model to quiz itself about the corpus content, resulting in a synthetic conversation trace. Training on these lets us avoid training on the same exact text multiple times and improves generality (see \\Cref{fig:micros}).\n",
      "To support corpora that exceed the effective context length of the model, we chunk the corpus when generating synthetic conversations. \n",
      "We also curate a set of seed prompts that bias the synthetic conversations towards global reasoning and improve structural awareness (see \\Cref{fig:ablations} right). \n",
      "    \\item \\textbf{Context distillation} (\\Cref{sec:method-objective}): We train on the synthetic conversations using a context-distillation objective~\\cite{bhargava2024prompt,snell2022learning}, which aligns the \\artifact-augmented model's next-token distributions with the distributions of the model with the corpus in context. We find that the context distillation substantially improves the quality of the \\artifacts compared to next-token-prediction (see \\Cref{fig:ablations} center).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, given a large corpus of text, our goal is to train a small virtual KV cache, termed \\artifact, that when used by the model, mimics the conversational behavior of the model with the entire corpus in context. To do this, we generate synthetic conversations and train the \\artifact on them with a context distillation objective --- a recipe we call \\method.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\textbf{Evaluations.} We evaluate \\artifacts trained with {\\method} on a set of challenging benchmarks that pair a single large text corpus ($100$k-$484$k tokens) with a diverse set of queries~\\cite{islam2023financebench,adams2024longhealth,tanzer2023benchmark}. \n",
      "We make three claims. \\textbf{First}, \\artifacts extends the quality-memory frontier---averaged across the benchmarks, \\artifacts produced with \\method match ICL quality while consuming $38.6\\times$ less memory, enabling a $26.4\\times$ increase in peak throughput (tokens per second) when serving many users with different corpora. These memory reductions and speedups represent an order of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art cache compression baselines (\\eg DuoAttention~\\cite{xiao2024duoattention}). \\textbf{Second}, \\artifacts enables context length extrapolation. On the MTOB benchmark~\\cite{tanzer2023benchmark}, where models must translate from Kalamang, a low-resource language, into English, we use \\method with \\llamaeightb to construct a small \\artifact from a $484$k token textbook.\n",
      "This \\artifact outperforms ICL over the first $130,000$ tokens of the textbook by $11.0$ chrF points and matches the ICL performance over a curated subset of the textbook.\n",
      "\\textbf{Third}, \\method also yields \\artifacts that are composable without joint optimization: multiple \\artifacts can be concatenated and queried together, emulating ICL's ability to flexibly answer queries over multiple documents concatenated in context (see \\Cref{fig:composition}).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we carefully ablate the design decisions in \\method and \\artifacts (\\Cref{sec:results-ablations} and \\Cref{app:results}). Notably, we compare \\artifacts parameterized as a KV cache~\\cite{li2021prefix} with \\artifacts parameterized as a LoRA \\cite{hu2022lora} and find that KV cache parameterization performs better on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we demonstrate how offline KV cache training can dramatically reduce the cost of serving language models in settings where users repeatedly include the same text corpora in context. \n",
      "We hope that these cost reductions could enable new applications that are currently intractable, like coding agents with full-repository context or long-term memory in chatbots.\n",

Another set of approaches exploits observations about the mathematical structure of the KV cache~\\cite{yu2024effectively,chang2024palu,kim2024lexico}, often finding that because a small number of keys dominate the attention scores of subsequent queries, non-impactful key-value pairs (or tokens) can be dropped~\\cite{ge2023model,zhang2023h2o,tang2024quest,oren2024transformers, li2024snapkv} or merged~\\cite{wang2024model,zhang2024cam,wan2024d2o}. \n",

      "We propose \\artifacts as an alternative to ICL for settings where many different user messages reference the same large corpus of text.  \n",
      "We demonstrate across a diverse set of language model workloads that, when trained via \\method, they match ICL's response quality while substantially reducing memory consumption  ($38.6\\times$ memory reduction across our evaluations) and increasing peak throughput ($26.4\\times$ higher tokens per second). \\artifacts are simple to train, composable, and compatible with existing LLM serving infrastructure. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, compared with ICL, \\method is not without limitations. \n",
      "Using \\method to produce a KV-cache is much more costly than simply running standard ICL pre-fill. \n",
      "With our unoptimized implementation, training an ICL-quality \\artifact takes $\\sim30$ minutes on a single $8\\times$H100 node (for \\llamaeightb)\n",
      "So our work does not provide a drop-in replacement for ICL, but rather demonstrates one way to tradeoff increased compute for reduced memory when constructing a KV-cache. \n",
      "This tradeoff is extremely advantageous in many settings: users often issue many queries over the same corpus and \\method can be trained offline on idle or underutilized compute (\\eg at night when user load is low~\\cite{jaiswal2025serving,goel2025niyama}). \n",
      "Furthermore, there is ample room for optimizations (\\eg improved shared-prefix attention kernels~\\cite{dao2022flashattention,ye2025flashinfer, juravsky2024hydragenhighthroughputllminference}) that would make \\method training procedure more efficient.\n",
      "\n",

      "Notably, we find that as we increase the \\artifact size with LoRA tuning, performance on out-of-domain queries (MMLU) drops significantly. At 1.06 GB (LoRA rank 1632), MMLU accuracy drops from $60.0\\%$ to $45.3\\%$. \n",
      "This drop in performance is highly correlated with the size of the \\artifact, suggesting that LoRA is not well-suited to large Cartridges, which we show in \\Cref{fig:tradeoff-within} are important for recovering ICL performance.\n",
      "In contrast, with prefix-tuning the accuracy only drops to $54.3\\%$ at 1.06 GB. This degradation is mostly invariant to the size of the \\artifact ($54.7\\%$ at 0.15 GB), demonstrating that out-of-domain performance is robust across \\artifact sizes.\n",

      "Interestingly, LoRA accuracy at the largest \\artifact sizes is lower; $41.3\\%$ at $0.96$. \n",
      "It is possible that this is due to the out-of-domain degradation of LoRA we discussed above. \n",

      "Below we discuss prior work from the parameter-efficient fine-tuning literature that inform the way we parameterize \\artifacts in our work. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\subsubsection{Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)}\n",
      "\\label{app:related-work-peft}\n",
      "In order to adapt large language models (LLMs) to particular domains or tasks in a more compute and memory-efficient manner, several parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed. Some of the most widely used PEFT methods include Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) \\cite{hu2022lora}, prefix-tuning \\cite{li2021prefix}, and prompt-tuning \\cite{lester2021power}. \n",
      "\n",
      "Leveraging prior observations that fine-tuned language models exhibit an intrinsic low rank structure, Hu \\etal propose LoRA, which freezes model parameters and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices between each transformer layer. LoRA exhibits on-par or better fine-tuning quality while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times \\cite{hu2022lora}. \n",
      "\n",
      "Li \\etal and Lester \\etal both take a different approach to lightweight fine-tuning, proposing tunable \"prefixes\" and \"soft prompts\" respectively to prepend to queries in order to steer the model to desired outputs. Li \\etal proposes prefix-tuning, which learns a continuous representation for the activation of the prefix at each transformer layer. These learned activations are then prepended to activations obtained by passing the input prompt through the frozen transformer. In contrast, Lester \\etal proposes prompt-tuning, which optimizes at the discrete token level and prepends a series of learnable tokens to the input prompt. Both methods show strong performance while greatly reducing the number of learnable parameters and improving compute and memory efficiency for language model adaptation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA) \\cite{meng2024pissa} is another more recent PEFT method that attempts to ameliorate the slow convergence problems of LoRA. PiSSA initializes the LoRA rank decomposition matrices with the principal components of the original matrix, and exhibits faster convergence and enhanced performance compared to LoRA on several tasks, including GSM8K and MATH. \n",
      "\n",
      "Several of these methods, especially LoRA, have been adapted specifically for distilling knowledge provided in context into the parameters of a language model. Some of those methods are described in the sections below, and this work is an extension of prefix-tuning for long-context tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\\subsubsection{Parameter-efficient Adapter Composition and Merging}\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of works have explored the idea of composing multiple different parameter-efficient adapters (\\eg LoRAs) by summing them together, concatenating them, or using a dynamic mixture of experts~\\cite{zhao2024merging,huang2023lorahub,xiao2024configurable,zhao2024loraretriever,yadav2024survey,wu2024mixture,gou2023mixture,li2024mixlora}.\n",
      "For example, Huang \\etal propose LoraHub, a framework for dynamically weighting and composing multiple language model adapters~\\cite{huang2023lorahub}. Given a set of LoRA modules for different upstream tasks and new unseen task with in-context examples, LoraHub dynamically weights the LoRAs and composes a new LoRA module for the task.   \n",
      "Similarly, Zhao \\etal propose a method for dynamically \\textit{retrieving} the most relevant language model LoRAs for a given task~\\cite{zhao2024loraretriever}.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\subsubsection{Parametric Knowledge Injection}\n",
      "\n",
      "Several recent works have explored methods for integrating external knowledge directly into model parameters, known as parametric knowledge injection ~\\cite{kujanpaa2024knowledge,mao2025lift,su2025parametricrag}. \n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, these studies are the closest in scope to ours.\n",
      "Like ours, these works address the problem of parametric knowledge injection: how to store large text corpora within parameters of a language model.\n",
      "Some use simple synthetic data generation pipelines or context-distillation objectives.\n",
      "Unlike our work, these studies do not highlight the memory reduction and throughput advantages of parametric knowledge injection techniques. \n",
      "We highlight other differences below.\n",
      "\n",
      "One parametric knowledge injection method, recently proposed by Kujanpaa \\etal, is prompt distillation, in which a teacher model with access to privileged knowledge generates question-answer pairs. These pairs are then used to train a LoRA adapter for a student model (identical to the teacher model, but without access to privileged information) using a distillation objective (i.e. mimicking the teacher's full token distribution) ~\\cite{kujanpaa2024knowledge}.\n",
      "This closely resembles our context-distillation objective, which we also found works better than next-token prediction.\n",
      "However, unlike our work, Kujanpaa \\etal only train LoRA adapters of a single size (rank 1024) and don't assess memory reductions with respect to full in-context learning. \n",
      "Indeed, they do not evaluate against long-context ICL baselines at all, focusing instead on a comparison with RAG. \n",
      "Furthermore, they evaluate on a relatively simple long-context setting -- a concatenation of SQUAD passages~\\cite{rajpurkar2016squad} -- which does not exhibit long range dependencies or require reasoning the way \\mtob and \\longhealth do. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, Mao \\etal propose Long Input Fine-tuning (LIFT), which fine-tunes a language model using a typical next-token prediction objective on overlapping segments of the corpus, as well as instruction tuning on question answer pairs generated from the corpus. \n",
      "Unlike our work, Mao \\etal find that synthetic Q/A pairs ``offer minimal benefit and can even degrade performance due to overfitting\"~\\cite{mao2025lift}. \n",
      "The difference in our findings is perhaps due to the fact that they only generate \\textit{ten} synthetic examples, whereas we generate \\textit{tens of thousands}. \n",
      "Furthermore, they use a weaker ICL baseline (Llama 3 8B) that only has 8k tokens of context. Any contexts longer than 8k tokens are truncated before being fed to the ICL baseline. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Su \\etal proposes Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation (Parametric RAG), in which each document has a corresponding LoRA adapter, trained on an augmented dataset consisting of the document, rewritten versions of the document, and question-answer pairs generated from the document. At inference time, a retriever is used to determine relevants documents, and the corresponding LoRA adapters are merged \\cite{su2025parametricrag}. This method demonstrates significant gains over RAG on a variety of tasks, including WikiMultihopQA. \n",

      "\\label{app:related-work-method}\n",
      "\n",
      "\\subsubsection{Self Distillation and Context Distillation}\n",
      "Self-distillation is another method used to internalize the performance gains provided by information in context (e.g. scratchpads, informative instructions) into the model parameters. In \"Learning by Distilling Context\", the authors distill a model with instructions and scratchpads in context into parameters  by conditioning the model on “[instructions] + [task-input]” to predict “[scratch-pad] + [final answer]”; then fine-tuning the same model to predict its own “[final answer]” conditioned on the “[task-input]”, without seeing the “[instructions]” or using the “[scratch-pad]” ~\\cite{snell2024scaling}. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\\subsubsection{Synthetic Data Generation}\n",
      "Due to the ubiquitous need for high quality data for fine-tuning (e.g. for use with the methods described above), a large body of work has focused on generating high quality synthetic data ~\\cite{nayak2024learning} \\cite{abdin2024phi} \\cite{gandhi2024datatune} \\cite{riaz2025metasynth}. For example, Bonito is a model that is fine-tuned to generate synthetic data \\cite{nayak2024learning}, and MetaSynth is a method proposed by Riaz \\etal that uses a language model to orchestrate several expert LLMs for domain-specific synthetic data generation \\cite{riaz2025metasynth}. The training process for Phi-4, a 14 billion parameter language model, also incorporates significant amounts of synthetically generated data \\cite{abdin2024phi}. Incorporating synthetic data, in conjunction with new post-training techniques, allows Phi-4 to surpass its teacher model on STEM QA tasks, as well as perform well for its size on reasoning benchmarks. These works demonstrate the potential for synthetic data generation methods to augment the capabilities of language models. \n",

      "\\subsection{Reducing the size of the KV cache}\n",
      "\\label{app:related-work-reducekv}\n",
      "In this section, we discuss existing approaches for reducing the size of the KV cache.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, in \\Cref{app:related-work-reduce-arch}, we describe works that propose architectural changes to the multi-head attention operation, which reduce the memory footprint of the KV cache. Next, in \\Cref{app:related-work-reducekv-prompt}, we discuss \\textit{prompt compression} methods, which reduce the size of the KV cache by converting a long sequence of input embeddings into a shorter one. They can be split into hard-token methods, which output discrete tokens from the vocabulary, and soft-token methods, which output new token embeddings not from the vocabulary.\n",
      "Finally, in \\Cref{app:related-work-reducekv-kvcache}, we describe \\textit{KV cache compression} methods. These methods directly modify the key and value matrices in the KV cache. Compared with prompt compression methods, these are more expressive because they can produce a KV cache that no sequence of input embeddings could have produced. \n",
      "\n",
      "The methodology proposed in our work relies on cache-tuning, which could be viewed as a form of KV cache compression.\n",
      "\n",

      "\\subsubsection{Prompt compression}\n",
      "\\label{app:related-work-reducekv-prompt}\n",
      "\\paragraph{Hard-token prompt compression}\n",
      "Some works aim to reduce the size of KV cache by converting a longer text into a shorter text~\\cite{jiang2023llmlingua,li2023unlocking,chuang2024learning,zhang2024adacomp,pan2024llmlingua}. These methods are typically referred to as \\textit{hard-token} prompt compression methods because the resulting KV cache comes from discrete tokens from the vocabulary. Compared with soft-token prompt methods, these methods work well with black-box API models. \n",
      "\n",
      "These methods can be broadly classified into two categories: filtering and summarization based methods. \n",
      "Filtering methods cut text from the original prompt using heuristics such as self-information. For example, LLMLingua and Selective-Context use a smaller LLM to filter a long prompt (\\textit{e.g.} dropping redundant tokens) before passing it to the main model~\\cite{jiang2023llmlingua,li2023unlocking}.\n",
      "Summarization methods paraphrase a long prompt into a smaller number of tokens~\\cite{chuang2024learning}.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\paragraph{Soft-token prompt compression with adapted LLMs}\n",
      "In one line of work, researchers train a model (typically an adapted LLM) to compress a long prompt into a smaller number of soft tokens~\\cite{chevalier2023adapting,yen2024long,ge2023context,mu2023learning,qin2023dodo}.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, \\textit{Autocompressors} and \\textit{In-context Autoencoders} (ICAE) are LLMs that are fine-tuned to output embeddings which can be used in soft-token prompts~\\cite{chevalier2023adapting,ge2023context}. Autocompressors are trained with full-parameter fine-tuning and leverage a recursive strategy to generate the soft prompts, whereas ICAEs are trained with LoRA and use a single forward pass to generate the soft prompts. \n",
      "A number of other works also propose using an auxiliary model to produce soft-tokens from a long prompt~\\cite{ge2023context,qin2023dodo}.\n",
      "\\textit{Gisting} is another method that differs from those above in that it uses the same LLM to compress the prompt into soft tokens as it uses to generate the response~\\cite{mu2023learning}.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\\paragraph{Soft-token prompt compression via gradient-descent}\n",
      "Soft tokens can also be produced by optimizing input token embeddings with gradient descent. \n",
      "This idea, called \\textit{prompt tuning}, was first proposed for the purpose of conditioning a frozen langauge model to perform specific tasks~\\cite{lester2021power}. \n",
      "As such, it is an important part of the parameter-efficient fine-tuning literature and is discussed in more detail in \\Cref{app:related-work-peft}. \n",
      "Since then, Li \\etal has extended prefix tuning techniques to long-context settings, proposing a new method called prefix propagation, which conditions prefixes on previous hidden states to achieve superior performance on long-document tasks compared to prefix tuning~\\cite{li2024mixlora}. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\subsubsection{KV cache compression} \n",
      "\\label{app:related-work-reducekv-kvcache}\n",
      "\n",
      "\\paragraph{Hard-token KV cache compression} Motivated by the observation that, in some settings, a small number of keys dominate the attention scores of subsequent queries, several works have proposed \\textit{KV cache eviction policies} wherein keys and values are dynamically dropped during generation~\\cite{ge2023model,zhang2023h2o,tang2024quest,oren2024transformers}. For example, H20 drops keys and values from \\textit{generated tokens} based on a running sum of historical attention scores~\\cite{zhang2023h2o}. Similarly, SnapKV drops keys and values from \\textit{prompt tokens} based on a window of queries from the end of the prompt~\\cite{li2024snapkv}.\n",
      "\n",
      "A major limitation of eviction methods is that once a key is evicted, it cannot be recovered. \n",
      "Instead of evicting keys permanently, another line of work focuses on selectively loading keys from KV cache to SMs. \n",
      "While these works do not reduce memory consumption of the KV cache, they can speed up inference by making better use of GPU memory bandwidth~\\cite{ribar2023sparq,tang2024quest}. For example, the Quest method estimates critical tokens at each decoding step and selectively loads them to SMs~\\cite{tang2024quest}.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared with the hard-token \\textit{prompt compression} methods, KV-cache compression methods allow fine-grained control at the level of an attention head. This means that a token can be dropped from one attention head but not another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\paragraph{Soft-token KV cache compression with merging} In another line of work, instead of evicting tokens from the KV cache, researchers propose merging similar tokens ~\\cite{wang2024model,zhang2024cam,wan2024d2o, liu2024minicache}. For example, Cache Merge (CaM) takes keys marked for eviction and merges them instead, using a weighting scheme based on attention weights \\cite{zhang2024cam}. Wang \\etal builds on this work by clustering key states into \"merge sets\" based on cosine similarity, and merging states within a \"merge set\" with a Gaussian kernel weighting scheme, which upweights states more similar to a pivotal state chosen as the token with the largest total attention score \\cite{wang2024model}. Wan \\etal expands on both these works with Dynamic Discriminative Operations (D2O), which performs optimizations at both the layer and token levels. D2O adjusts the KV cache budget for each layer based on its attention density and uses an exponential moving average mechanism to dynamically determine when a previously discarded token is similar enough to retained tokens to be merged back in \\cite{wan2024d2o}. All of these works demonstrate promising results, offering similar or better performance on several tasks compared to a full cache with a 50\\% or more reduction in cache size. However, there is still room for further improvement, as these methods still fail to match full cache performance in several tasks, and even a 50\\% reduction in cache size may still be prohibitively expensive for very large models or very long contexts. Additionally, these works do not evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in long-context settings. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\paragraph{Soft-token KV cache compression with low-rank projection} A number of works leverage the observation that the KV cache exhibits low-rank structure to develop compression methods ~\\cite{yu2024effectively,chang2024palu, zhang2024lorc, zhou2025elitekv, saxena2024eigenattn}. Similar to compression methods based on merging, compression methods based on low-rank adaptation achieve performances similar to or exceeding full caches on several tasks at 50\\% compression, while experiencing performance degradation upon further compression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\paragraph{Soft-token KV cache compression with adapted LLMs}\n",
      "Above we discussed how some works adapt an LLM to output a shorter sequence of soft tokens given a long context. Similarly, one could adapt an LLM to output a smaller KV cache given a long context. While less explored than the analagous prompt compression approach, there is at least one published method that falls into this category. \n",
      "In \\textit{KV-distill}, the authors add LoRA adapters to an LLM's query projections and train them to to produce queries which aggregate information from prior tokens~\\cite{chari2025kv}. \n",
      "The adapter is applied selectively to some tokens and only these tokens are kept in the KV cache.\n",
      "The idea is that these selected tokens can act as sinks to collect information from prior tokens. \n",
      "The adapter is trained with a distillation objective between a compressed and uncompressed KV cache. However, unlike our work, KV-distill does not use any training at test time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\paragraph{Soft-token KV cache compression with gradient-descent} The idea of treating the keys and value matrices in a KV cache as weights and training them with gradient descent was first discussed in the prefix-tuning paper~\\cite{li2021prefix}.\n",
      "In this work, the method was not applied to long-contexts, but rather as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that can be applied to training datasets with input-output pairs, so we discuss it in more detail in \\ref{app:related-work-peft}. \n",
      "Since then, we are not aware of works that have applied this technique to handle long-contexts. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\subsubsection{Architectural changes}\n",
      "\\label{app:related-work-reduce-arch}\n",
      "A number of works have proposed architectural changes to the original multi-head attention (MHA) operation~\\cite{vaswani2017attention} that reduce the memory footprint of the KV cache. \n",
      "Because they fundamentally alter the architecture, these methods are not immediately compatible with pre-trained models using the standard MHA operation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest works in this direction developed fixed sparsity patterns in the attention map~\\cite{beltagy2020longformer,child2019generating,zaheer2020big}. For example, many works use a sliding window sparsity pattern wherein each token attends to a fixed window of tokens around it. These approaches reduce the size of the KV cache because they require only keeping around a fixed number of tokens in the KV cache. \n",
      "More recently, some large language models have adopted sliding window sparsity in a subset of layers/heads~\\cite{team2024gemma}.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the methods above reduce the size of the cache by introducing sparsity at the token-level, another class of methods changes the structure of the attention heads. Multi-query attention (MQA), the earliest of such modifications, uses multiple query heads but only a single key and value head~\\cite{shazeer2019fast}.\n",
      "While MQA dramatically reduces the size of the KV cache, it can lead to a significant drop in the expressive power of the model. Grouped-query attention (GQA) is a middle ground between MQA and MHA that allows a group of query heads to attend to a single key and value head~\\cite{ainslie2023gqa}. Many frontier models use GQA, including the Llama 3 architecture, which we use in our experiments~\\cite{dubey2024llama3,jiang2024identifying,yang2024qwen2}.\n",
      "More recently, a number of other architectural modifications have been proposed including including Multi-head Latent Attention~\\cite{liu2024deepseek} and Tensor Product Attention~\\cite{zhang2025tensor}.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another line of work, researchers observe that without the softmax operation in the attention mechanism (\\textit{i.e.} linearizing the attention operator), the KV cache can be faithfully represented by the fixed size matrix $K^\\top V$~\\cite{arora2024simple}. This allows us to represent the KV cache with a single matrix whose size is independent of the context length.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, a large body of work has focused on developing architectures with fixed-size memory consumption (\\textit{i.e.} models that do away with the KV cache). Notable examples include state-space models~\\cite{gu2023mamba}, RNNs~\\cite{beck2024xlstm}, and other linear attention variants~\\cite{arora2024simple,yang2024parallelizing}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior work shows that there are tradeoffs between the memory consumption of an architecture and the ability of a model to perform recall-intensive tasks, when controlling for compute (\\ie FLOPs)~\\cite{arora2024simple}. \n",
      "In this context, our work shows that by increasing compute (\\ie FLOPs), we can reduce the memory consumption of a model without sacrificing performance. \n",
      "In \\Cref{app:theory}, we provide a prelinary theoretical analysis relating \\method with recurrent architectures. However, future work should explore the relationship between \\artifacts and recurrent models in more depth.\n",

      "\\subsubsection{Orchestration for long-context}\n",
      "In this section, we describe strategies for managing long-contexts by orchestrating calls to LLMs.\n",
      "For instance, the approach by \\citep{russak2024writing} involves summarizing chunks of the context and then combining the summaries. Similarly, PRISM \\citep{jayalath2024long} treats the context as a sequence of chunks, capturing key information in a structured data format. MemGPT \\citep{packer2023memgpt} introduces a virtual memory paging system, drawing inspiration from operating systems.
